                            Their main difference is that local storage data does not expire, whereas session storage
                            data
                            gets cleared when the user closes its browser window.
                            Page sessions are valid for only one tab at a time. So, if a user has three tabs open, each
                            one
                            will have its own page session. Since local storage is not session-based, all the data must
                            be
                            deleted via javascript or
                            manually.
                            In conclusion, local storage is best for storing data you want to keep long term, even after
                            the
                            user has closed the tab or browser. Session storage is best for storing temporary data or
                            data
                            that should only be accessible from
                            one tab.

                            A variable's scope is the range of the script where it is visible. Variables have either
                            global
                            or local scope. A global variable exists only once in a script, and is visible in every
                            function. Modifications to it in one function are permanent and visible to all functions.
                            Unless
                            declared otherwise, all variables in a script are global. Global variables are useful for
                            values
                            that are relatively constant, or that many functions in the script must access, such as a
                            session id.

                            A local variable, however, has a limited scope: it exists only within the block that it is
                            declared in. Once that block ends, the variable is destroyed and its values lost. A local
                            variable of the same name declared elsewhere is a different variable. A local variable can
                            even
                            exist multiple times simultaneously, if its block is entered again before it's exited - i.e.
                            a
                            recursive function call. Each call of the function will have a distinct local variable.

                            JavaScript is a single-threaded language. In other words, it can do only one thing at a
                            time.
                            JavaScript executes all operations on a single thread, but using a few smart data
                            structures,
                            gives us the illusion of multi-threading. The event loop is the secret behind JavaScriptâ€™s

                            <strong>Heap</strong>
                            Objects are allocated in a heap which is just a name to denote a large (mostly unstructured)
                            region of memory.
                            <br>
                            <strong> Queue</strong>
                            A JavaScript runtime uses a message queue, which is a list of messages to be processed. Each
                            message has an associated function that gets called to handle the message.

                            At some point during the event loop, the runtime starts handling the messages on the queue,
                            starting with the oldest one. To do so, the message is removed from the queue and its
                            corresponding function is called with the message as an input parameter. As always, calling
                            a
                            function creates a new stack frame for that function's use.

                            The processing of functions continues until the stack is once again empty. Then, the event
                            loop
                            will process the next message in the queue (if there is one).
